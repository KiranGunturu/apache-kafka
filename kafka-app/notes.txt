- when we have topic with single partition, all the messages will be written to the same topic
- when we have topic with 2 partitions, messages will be published to both the partitions and it is all random not round robin.

### consumer
- consumer can be defined as logical grouping of one or more consumers
- it is mandatory for a consumer to register itself to a consumer group
- consumer instances are seperate process
- consumer instance of same consumer group can be on different brokers
- every consumer is always assigned to a consumer group
- if no group_id is provided then random group id is assigned

### when we have 1 topic, 1 consumer and 2 partitions, 
    - messages will be published to partition randomly and messages will be consumed by c1 consumer in round robin fashion
    - one consumer can read from 2 different partitions

### when we have 1 topic, 1 partition and 2 consumers
- here both consumers are registered to same consumer group
- same partition can't be assigned to multiple consumer in the same group that means in this case, one consumer will sit idle
- but if they are belongs to diff consumer group then they can read from same partition

### when we have 1 topic, 2 partitions and 2 consumers
- here both consumers are registered to same consumer group
- both the consumers will read 2 partitions and reading is random
